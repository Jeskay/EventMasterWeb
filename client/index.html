                    Events master gives people freedom to interact during the event. The bot will save time of server moderators for other purposes. Let members do something themselves and they will acknowledge it. More of that it's simple to use - just set two channels with a handy slash command from the bot's advice and it will run out of the box!

That's why Eventmaster keep this announcement function but also makes it possible to announce specific event all across the discord. So every user subscribed to this event will receive a notification regardless of whether he is a member of the server or not. Just add a #mycoolevent to your accouncment message.
